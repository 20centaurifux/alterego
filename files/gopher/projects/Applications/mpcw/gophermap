Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------

MPC Wear is a MPD client for Wear OS.

It connects your wearable device to a MPD server running in
your local network over WiFi. You can control the daemon,
browse your music collection and add music to the queue.

Network connection
------------------------------------------------------------

When a Wear OS device has a Bluetooth connection to a phone,
the network traffic is proxied through the phone. It cannot
access local network resources. Therefore MPC Wear connects
to MPD over WiFi.

Please keep in mind that MPC Wear might not be able to
connect to your MPD server if battery saver is turned on.
