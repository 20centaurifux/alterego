Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------

This is the source code of the Arduino Nano based weather
station I'm developing at the moment. The project is still
under construction.

The station measures temperature, atmospheric pressure,
humidity and UV intensity. Data is stored using delta
compression and sent over 433mhz in a regular interval.

Pressing a button the weather station shows the current
measurement on a 7-segment display and a customized analog
voltmeter.
