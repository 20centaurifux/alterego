# WeatherStation

The Arduino Nano based weather station I'm developing at the moment. The
project is still under construction.

The station measures temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity and UV
intensity. Data is stored using delta compression and sent over 433mhz in
a regular interval.

Pressing a button the weather station shows the current measurement on a
7-segment display and a customized analog voltmeter.
