Hi, my name is Sebastian. I'm a [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
addicted software developer from Germany :)

I made software for technical, administrative and safety management of yachts over the
last decade. Now I work in parking space management.

On this site you find mostly information about projects I created in my spare time and
that I want to share.
