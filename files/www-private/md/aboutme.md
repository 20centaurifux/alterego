Hi, my name is Sebastian. I'm a software developer from Germany.

I made software for technical, administrative and safety management of yachts
over the last decade. Now I work in parking space management.

On this site you find information about projects I created in my spare time and
that I want to share.

I have also a [Gopher site](gopher://dixieflatline.de). If your browser doesn't
support Gopher you can use the [Floodgap proxy](https://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?gopher%3A%2F%2Fdixieflatline.de).
